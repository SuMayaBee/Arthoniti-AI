## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

### Architectural Philosophy: Why Microservices?

We deliberately chose a microservices architecture to build a system that mirrors the structure of a modern, agile engineering organization. This approach provides immense benefits that are critical for an enterprise-grade platform:

- **Scalability:** Each service can be scaled independently. If video generation becomes popular, we can scale up the short-video-generator service without touching the auth-service.
- **Resilience:** A failure in one service (e.g., the logo-generator is temporarily down) does not bring down the entire application. Other services like Chat and Market Analysis remain fully functional.
- **Technology Autonomy:** Each service uses the best tools for its job. The rag-service uses a specialized vector database, while other services use standard relational models.
- **Maintainability:** Smaller, focused codebases are easier to understand, maintain, and update, enabling rapid iteration and development.

### Foundational Pillars

Two non-negotiable components form the backbone of our distributed system.

- **API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway):** The single entry point for all client requests. It acts as a reverse proxy, routing traffic to the appropriate internal service. This provides a crucial security layer (internal services are not publicly exposed) and a central place to manage cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and logging.
- **Service Registry (Netflix Eureka):** The "phonebook" of our system. Every microservice registers itself with Eureka upon startup. When one service needs to communicate with another, it asks Eureka for the target service's current network location. This enables dynamic scaling and resilience, as service instances can be added or removed without any manual reconfiguration.

### Inter-Service Communication

Our architecture employs two distinct patterns for communication, chosen based on the specific needs of the interaction.

- **Synchronous Communication (REST via OpenFeign):** Used when a service requires an immediate, blocking response from another to complete its task.
	- *Prime Example:* The chat-service must get context from the rag-service before generating a final answer. It uses a declarative Spring Cloud OpenFeign client to make a simple, type-safe REST call. OpenFeign automatically integrates with Eureka for service discovery.
- **Asynchronous Communication (Server-Sent Events):** Used for pushing real-time updates from the server to the client.
	- *Prime Example:* The market-analysis-service performs a long-running, multi-step analysis. Instead of making the user wait, it streams status updates and results via SSE, providing a live, transparent view of the AI's progress.

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Apache Maven 3.8+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL Server
- Access to OpenAI and Google AI Platform APIs

### How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
	 ```bash
	 git clone https://github.com/SuMayaBee/Therap-JavaFest-2025.git
	 cd arthoniti-ai
	 ```
2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
	 - Each service contains an `application.yml` file. Update the database credentials and API keys (OpenAI, Google) as marked (`# CHANGE ME`).
3. **Set up Databases:**
	 - For each service, create its corresponding PostgreSQL database (e.g., `auth_db`, `chat_db`, `rag_db`, etc.).
	 - For `rag_db` and `presentation_db`, ensure you enable the vector extension:
		 ```sql
		 CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
		 ```
4. **Build All Modules:**
	 ```bash
	 mvn clean install
	 ```
5. **Run the Services (in order):**
	 - **Step 1: Start Core Infrastructure**
		 - Start the service-registry first, then the api-gateway.
		 ```bash
		 # In /service-registry
		 mvn spring-boot:run

		 # In a new terminal, for /api-gateway
		 mvn spring-boot:run
		 ```
	 - **Step 2: Start Application Services**
		 - Open a new terminal for each of the 10 application microservices (auth-service, market-analysis-service, etc.) and run the following command in each directory:
		 ```bash
		 mvn spring-boot:run
		 ```
		 - It is recommended to start services with fewer dependencies first (like rag-service) before starting services that depend on them (like chat-service).

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Roadmap

- [ ] **Containerization:** Fully containerize each service with Docker for simplified deployment.
- [ ] **Kubernetes Deployment:** Create Helm charts to deploy the entire stack to a Kubernetes cluster.
- [ ] **Distributed Tracing:** Integrate Micrometer Tracing and Zipkin for end-to-end request tracing.
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement a full CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate builds, tests, and deployments.
- [ ] **Asynchronous Messaging:** Introduce a message broker like RabbitMQ or Kafka for event-driven communication between select services to further enhance decoupling.
